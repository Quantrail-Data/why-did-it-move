"""The optional chat feature: free-text question -> structured lookup ->
narrated answer. Reuses investigate.py's query functions directly rather
than duplicating query logic - this endpoint exists specifically because it
was cheap to add once the core pipeline existed, per the MVP-scope decision.

Accepts an optional `context` (the currently-open investigation's
metric/day/segment) so an unqualified follow-up like "why was CTR normal
though?" resolves against whatever the user was just looking at, instead of
silently defaulting to the latest loaded day every time.
